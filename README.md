## What are we building?
### Vision
Creating an immersive digital experience (web application) for all exhibition visitors to enable them to have deeper interactions with all the exhibits, while also showcasing the power of credentialing. 

In order to achieve the second goal (of showcasing the power of credentialing), the app needs to bring out the following,
1. Conviction: It should clearly show our strong belief in the power and value prop of credentials
2. Provocation: The experience should provoke the users into thinking about how they can leverage credentialing 

### Problem
We are building a digital experience web app, which will aim to solve the following problems,

1. The visitors lack information about schedule and details of all the exhibits/ kiosks 
2. Lack of interest generation and excitement about the exhibits
3. Generating excitement around credentialing 

### Solution
1. App will provide exhibit details and schedule in an easily accessible manner
2. Gamification of interaction of visitors with all exhibits in the form of a quizzes, games, and leaderboard will keep the users engaged and excited
3. Gamification to also showcase how credentials can be issued, rendered, and verified (while also gaining some benefit out of the credential)
